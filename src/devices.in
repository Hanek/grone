#
# device template for automatic device generation
#
# - device members must be included inside the block denoted by curly brackets
# - device name must precede member's block
# - each device, bracket and data member must occupy single line
# - each data member must contain exactly two tokens
# - generator performs some very basic checks and would fail with meaningful error
